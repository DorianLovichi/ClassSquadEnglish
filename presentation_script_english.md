# 🎙️ English Presentation Script: Class Squad (5 Minutes)

Use this script as a guide for your presentation. Do not read it word-for-word, but use the bullet points to keep your flow natural.

## 1. Demonstrate your webpage (Approx. 1-2 mins)

> **Action:** Open the webpage. Start at the top.

**Introduction:**
"Good morning everyone. For my English project, I decided to build **Class Squad**. Instead of a simple list of names, I wanted to create an **immersive experience**—something that feels like the official website of a premium football club like Manchester United."

**How does it work?**
"The concept is simple but visual. We have two main teams: **Full-Stack** and **Data Engineer**."

> **Action:** Click on the "Data Engineer" tab.
> "As you can see, the switch is instant—no page reload. This makes the app feel very fast."

> **Action:** Hover over a player card (e.g., Abdou).
> "When I hover over a player, you see this 'lifting' effect. It invites you to click."

> **Action:** Click on a player to show the profile.
> "If I click on [Player Name], we get their full scouting report. I included details like their 'Tech Role', strong points, and even a 'fun fact' to make it personal."

## 2. Explain your work (Approx. 1.5 mins)

**Which coding languages did you use?**
"I chose a **Vanilla Stack**. That means I used:

1.  **HTML5** for the structure.
2.  **CSS3** for all the styling and animations.
3.  **JavaScript (ES6)** for the logic."

**Which techniques did you use?**
"I didn't use any heavy frameworks like React. I wanted to show that you can build a modern app with just the basics if you master them.

- **DOM Manipulation:** My JavaScript dynamically retrieves the data from a JSON file and builds these cards instantly.
- **CSS Variables:** I effectively used variables for colors and spacing. This makes it easy to change the entire theme from 'Dark Mode' to 'Light Mode' in seconds."

**Layout, Style & Fonts:**
"For the design, I went for a **'Dark Luxury' aesthetic**.

- **Style:** I used **Glassmorphism** (the blurry transparent header) to give it a modern, premium feel.
- **Layout:** I used **CSS Grid** for the player cards because it’s fully responsive—it creates a perfect layout on both mobile and desktop screens.
- **Font:** I chose **Poppins**. It’s a geometric sans-serif font that looks very clean and 'tech-focused'."

## 3. Justify your choices (Approx. 1.5 mins)

**Why did you choose to use/do these things?**
"I chose the **Dark Mode** because it highlights the player photos better and feels more 'elite' than a standard white page.
I chose **Vanilla JavaScript** (no framework) because this is a small project. React would have been overkill—too heavy and complex for what I needed. This approach keeps the site incredibly fast and lightweight."

**If you had MORE time, what would you have done differently?**
"I would have added a **'Compare Players'** feature, where you could select two students and see their skills side-by-side, like in the FIFA video games. I also would have connected it to a real database instead of a static file."

**If you had LESS time?**
"I would have removed the **Profile Page** and just kept the main list. I also would have simplified the card effects—removing the hover animations would have saved me a lot of CSS debugging time!"

## 4. Questions from Mr. Williams (Preparation)

**Q: "Why didn't you use Bootstrap or Tailwind?"**
A: "I wanted to practice my raw CSS skills. Frameworks are great for speed, but writing your own CSS gives you 100% control over the unique 'premium' look I wanted."

**Q: "Is this website responsive?"**
A: "Yes, absolutely. Because I used CSS Grid, the columns automatically adjust from 4 columns on a laptop down to 1 column on a smartphone."

**Q: "How did you get the photos to look consistent?"**
A: "I used a CSS filter (`grayscale`) that makes them black and white, but when you hover, they burst into color. This solves the problem of everyone having different lighting in their photos."
