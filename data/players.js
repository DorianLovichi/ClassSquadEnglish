    evaluation:
      "Dorian has evolved from a dependable starter into the squad's anchor, and the transformation shows in every phase of delivery. Over the past year he redesigned our intake process, pairing early technical framing with just the right stakes for experimentation. His discovery workshops feel like a locker room huddle: inclusive, focused, and always forward-looking. Teammates trust that he will challenge assumptions without dismissing the work already invested, which keeps morale high even when the backlog gets dense. When a project risks slipping, he calmly realigns priorities, negotiates scope with stakeholders, and protects teammates from unnecessary pressure. That blend of care and decisiveness has made him the go-to person for the trickiest cross-team collaborations.\n\nOn the technical front, Dorian continues to push the squad toward modern, sustainable architecture. He championed our move to feature toggles, cutting the time between pull request merge and deploy from days to hours. He also launched a pairing rotation that lets newer teammates shadow senior developers on production code, accelerating growth across the team. His code reviews read like training sessions: concise, constructive, and sprinkled with practical examples that encourage autonomy. Looking ahead, he wants to formalize a mentorship program that matches juniors with specialists for four-week cycles, complete with measurable goals and post-cycle retros. With his talent for narrative and his ability to keep all eyes on the bigger picture, Dorian is not just ready for the next division - he is already coaching the squad to play there. He is already sketching the roadmap for a community hackathon series.",
